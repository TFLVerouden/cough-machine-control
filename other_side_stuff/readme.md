The following stuff is in here:
- coughplotter folder has the raw images and clicked results using imageJ as .csv.
- all_coughs.py plots these. coughplotter_xxx.svg are the results of these also shown in thesis of Sikkema 2025
- averaging_normal_distributions.nb is a wolfram script, where one sees what the effect of averaging two normal distributions is.
- Calculatingdimensionlessnumbers is an excel with dimensionless numbers and all relevant variables
- effect of LED lightonspraytec shows what the effect is of the LED if you turn it on after background checking the spraytec
- gammadistributionexamplevillermaux lets you play with two component mixture distributions
- getscreensfromvideos and getscreensfromvideos.py are just scripts to load in one .tif file from recording and processing them so that the noise is gone.

- height_spraytec.py shows the place of the Spraytec 
- PIVvsflowmeter.py compares the flowmeter data to our PIV meausrements
- refractive_index.py calculates the refractive index for our PEO solutions, and shows that it is insignicant

- Spraytec_jet_tester.py is the code to process the images of the water jets to radiuses and fit them into size distributions!

-video_maker.py is the code on how I converted TIF to videos
