Text file explaining how to use the processing codes.
We assume that you have saved all the data of the averages and the raw data.
Now we  need so called keyphrases, which is just the bulk of your txt file. Make sure you have no typos.

**spraytec_rawdataplotter.py**:
Enter keyphrase
The code will make colormesh plots showing the PDFs over time. 
The results are saved as .svg in Results_spraytec->Time_plots->"The keyphrase used"

**spraytec_fulldataset.py**
Enter the keyphrase
Goes through all average files with this keyphrase
Returns a csv file with all the wanted statistics for this keyphrase
Saves this in Results_spraytec ->csv 

**Spraytec_averaging.py**
Enter keyphrase
Goes through all average files with this keyphrase
Makes PDFs for every file
Saves this as .svg in Results_spraytec->Time_plots->"The keyphrase used"
